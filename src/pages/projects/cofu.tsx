            <p>
                Inspired by California`&apos;s cottage kitchen program, Cofu (Community-Food) emerged as a cross-platform mobile marketplace during HackSC, USC`&apos;s intense 36-hour hackathon. In a team of 3, I played dual roles â€“ project manager and mobile developer. Despite the COVID-induced distance, our teamwork clinched us the vertical winner spot. It was a pivotal experience, giving me the chops to navigate large projects seamlessly. This hackathon wasn`&apos;t just about coding; it was a lesson in leadership and the first app where I confidently steered a ship through the hackathon storm.
